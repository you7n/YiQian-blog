名字由来：小猫咪橘白相间的长毛像温暖的拿铁咖啡上的奶泡。它的眼睛清澈，性格温顺友好，总能给人带来温馨和愉悦。因此取名拿铁。

Name: Latte

Name Origin: The kitten’s long orange-and-white fur resembles the frothy milk foam on a warm latte coffee. Its clear eyes and gentle, friendly personality always bring warmth and joy to those around it. Hence the name “Latte.”

## 昏晓 DuskDawn

名字：昏晓

年龄：半岁

性别：女生

名字由来：造化钟神秀，阴阳割昏晓。昏晓是一只阴阳脸的猫猫，ta的脸上像有一个面具，被一分为二，因此取名昏晓

Name: DuskDawn

Age: Half a year

Gender: Female

Name Origin: Inspired by the verse, “Nature endows its exquisite beauty; light and shadow split dusk and dawn.” DuskDawn is a cat with a yin-yang face, as if wearing a mask divided into two halves. Thus, the name “DuskDawn” was chosen.

## 小塔 Little Thanatos

名字：小塔

年龄：半岁

性别：未知

名字由来：它的全名是收割者塔纳托斯，源于希腊神话，象征死亡之神，执掌生命的终结。然而，在我们的眼中，这不仅是一种严肃的象征，更是一种生命轮回的诗意表达。小猫纯黑的毛色如同夜晚般深邃，仿佛凝聚了宇宙的静谧与未知，与塔纳托斯的形象完美契合。它的存在提醒我们珍惜生命中的每一刻，同时也以独特的方式传递了一种庄严而深刻的美感。

Name: Little Thanatos

Age: Half a year

Gender: Unknown

Name Origin: Its full name is Thanatos the Reaper, derived from Greek mythology, symbolizing the god of death who governs the end of life. However, in our eyes, this is not merely a solemn symbol but also a poetic expression of the cycle of life. The kitten’s jet-black fur is as deep as the night, embodying the tranquility and mystery of the cosmos, perfectly resonating with the image of Thanatos. Its presence reminds us to cherish every moment of life while uniquely conveying a sense of profound and majestic beauty.


## 茅台 Moutai

名字：茅台

年龄：半岁

性别：未知

名字由来：名字接地气点好养活，希望茅台能跟茅台酒一样生活富贵荣华顺顺当当。

Name: Moutai

Age: Half a year

Gender: Unknown

Name Origin: The name was chosen for its down-to-earth charm, symbolizing hopes for an easy and prosperous life. Just like the famous Moutai liquor, it embodies wishes for wealth, luxury, and smooth sailing in life.

## 年年 NianNian

名字：年年

年龄：两岁

性别：女生

名字由来：年年是八十猫协救助的第一只猫猫！2024年4月她刚刚生产完一窝六只的小猫，却表现出了明显的猫鼻支和杯状，后来经过了我们两个月的努力，她平安地重返校园，她的宝宝们也全部被领养。直接参与救助的同学希望她之后可以年年都活着，于是就给她取了这个名字！

Name: NianNian

Age: Two years

Gender: Female

Name Origin: NianNian was the first cat rescued by the Eighty Cats Association! In April 2024, she had just given birth to a litter of six kittens but showed clear signs of feline rhinotracheitis and calicivirus. After two months of care, she safely returned to campus, and all her kittens were adopted. The students involved in her rescue hoped she could live year after year, so they gave her this name.

## 岁岁 SuiSui

名字：岁岁

年龄：七岁

性别：女生

名字由来：岁岁是目前八十中学里面活的最久的猫猫！她最早的可查证目击记录是在2018年，那时她已经是大猫了！她这么多年每年春夏来到我们校园留下她的崽。（之前每年冬天都要死一批但猫协成立后存活率极高）她的生存能力极强，相比于流浪猫野猫更适合形容她。2024年上半年她有过一次难产，还没来得及救助就消失两个月，我们都以为她死掉了但后来她又玩好的出现了！于是我们将她命名为岁岁，希望她大难不死必有后福，可以一直自由洒脱地活下去！（要尽快把她绝育了！）

Name: SuiSui

Age: Seven years

Gender: Female

Name Origin: SuiSui is currently the longest-living cat at BJ80! The earliest verifiable sighting of her was in 2018, and she was already an adult then. Over the years, she has returned to campus every spring and summer to leave behind her litters. (Previously, many would not survive winter, but since the Cat Association was established, survival rates have significantly improved.) Her survival skills are remarkable, making “feral cat” a more fitting description for her than “stray cat.” In early 2024, she had a difficult labor, disappearing for two months before rescue could be organized. Everyone thought she had died, but she eventually reappeared in good health! Thus, she was named SuiSui, with hopes that she would continue to overcome challenges and live a carefree life. (She needs to be spayed as soon as possible!)

## 报警器 Alarm

名字：报警器

年龄：一岁半

性别：未知

名字由来：这只猫特别警惕人类！只要一靠近它五米范围就开始尖叫，所以我们给它起名警报器。

Name: Alarm

Age: One and a half years

Gender: Unknown

Name Origin: This cat is extremely wary of humans! It starts screaming as soon as anyone comes within five meters, so it was named Alarm.
